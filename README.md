# 🏷️ Walmart Sparkathon – AI-Driven Multi-modal Shopping Assistant

**Problem Statement**: Customers often hesitate to purchase apparel online due to uncertainty about fit, appearance, and style suitability, leading to lower confidence, increased returns, and a less engaging shopping experience.

**Solution**: An AI-driven Multi-modal Shopping Assistant that understands text, voice, and image queries, provides personalized recommendations, and enables Virtual Try-On using GenAI to overlay selected apparel on user images/videos, boosting confidence in purchases.

## 👥 Team Members & Responsibilities

We are a team of four collaborating on this project for the Walmart Sparkathon. **Harshit** is leading the frontend development and handling DevOps responsibilities, setting up the monorepo with Turborepo and pnpm, and guiding the overall project structure. **Vedika** is responsible for building the backend using Node.js with GraphQL, managing all server-side logic and API development. **Dristant** is focusing on the mobile application, developing it using **Kotlin (Android)** to ensure seamless user experience on mobile platforms. **Manodeep** is handling all the AI-related features and integrations, working with APIs like Tavily and Groq to power intelligent features within the application. Together, we're aiming to build a full-stack solution with both web and mobile interfaces, supported by robust AI capabilities.
